This library contains a generic implementation of the `prettyVal` function
from the [pretty-show][0] package. Using the pretty printer, values can
easily be rendered to strings and HTML documents in a uniform way.

This library makes use of the [generics-sop][1] package and is an example
of a generic function defined in the SOP style.

This is the development repository. For releases, look on [Hackage][2].
